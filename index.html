		<h2>Luna</h2>
		<img class="pics" src="./images/20180920_182737-01.jpeg" alt="Luna" width="400" height="400">
		<p>Luna is a pitbull/bulldog.  She was born in April 2017. Luna has maximum energy levels at all times, but is a little bit clumsy. She still runs into walls and jumps under tables. She has no sense of personal space and will follow anyone, anywhere, all day.  If you get up, she gets up. If you sit, she sits... on your foot.</p>
		<img class="pics" src="C:\Users\Sarah\Desktop\LC101\html-me-something\images\20180602_153320-01.jpeg" alt="Luna" width="400" height="400">
		<p>She's very active. Cardio is her favorite exercise.  There's a hill in the backyard that she runs laps around, keeping us safe from stray bunnies and squirrels.</p>

		<p>She's such a curious little thing.  She used to visit the neighbor's yard. A lot. How? Well, it took a while to catch her. She stood on some bricks and lept over the top of the fence. Being only 3 years old, she didn't know any better. She also didn't know how to get back without bricks on the other side. So, when she was done exploring, she would wait patiently for someone to come save her. Little did she know, her mom is 5'1" and can barely lean over a fence, must less lift 70 lbs with flailing nails clawing for ground.</p>

		<p>Eventually we got her a pretty new necklace that vibrates when she gets too close to the fence.<br>She broke it.</p>

		<p>Luna was the tiniest baby. So small that her dad was able to take her to work.  She woud sit in a small box on his desk and everyone would come by to see her. She loved the attention.</p>

		<p>She still thinks she's a baby.</p>

		<h2>King Leoniatas</h2>
		<img class="pics" src="C:\Users\Sarah\Desktop\LC101\html-me-something\images\20180602_153138-02.jpeg" alt="Leo" width="400" height="400">
		<p>This is King Leoniatas. He goes by Leo. Leo is a boxer/pitbull and he's the goodest good boy ever. He was born December 2014. He had a really bad childhood and has some anxiety because of it, so we try to make him as comfortable as we can. His fears include new people, new surroundings, new furniture, and trying new things.</p>
		<img class="pics" src="C:\Users\Sarah\Desktop\LC101\html-me-something\images\20190630_121658-01.jpeg" alt="Leo" width="400" height="400">
		<p>He loves car rides, walks, and scratches. Every once in a while, we'll come home and Alexa is on.  Because of this, we've determined that Leo speaks English, and his favorite music is EDM.<br>Either that, or we have a faulty Alexa.</p>
		<p>If Leo were a human, his drink of choice would be a Macallan 18, neat. He would spend his time sitting at his executive desk surrounded by the finest literature, and tell tales of the good ol' days.</p>

		<p>This is Gigi. She doesn't really like me.</p>
